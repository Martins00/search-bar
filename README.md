# search-bar
Another simple project in my #31daysofjs practice.

I am a huge football fan, so whilst studying array functions, I decided to work on a simple search bar.

I am writing functions that can make a search-bar responsive.

First, I wrote a function that makes you search for a player name by filtering through an array of strings that contain player names in th data.js file.

After I got this, I decided to step it up a bit by changing the array of strings to an array of objects. I was ble to make it work too.

Currently, I am trying to write a function with which you can select a the country using the htnl select tag, and it displays the names of players from that country.

AOO -  Array of objects

AOS - Array of strings
